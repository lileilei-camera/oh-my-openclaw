# Ultrawork Workflow

Complete automation workflow that takes a task from analysis to verified completion.

## Trigger
When the user invokes `/ultrawork [task description]` or ultrawork mode is activated.

## Prerequisites
- Task description must be clear and actionable
- Working directory must be a valid project

## Workflow Steps

### Phase 1: Analysis (Prometheus)
```
1. Read the task description carefully
2. Analyze the current codebase state
   - Run `git status` to check working tree
   - Read relevant files to understand context
   - Identify affected modules and dependencies
3. Create a structured plan with:
   - Clear task breakdown (numbered steps)
   - Dependencies between steps
   - Category assignment for each step (quick/deep/ultrabrain/visual-engineering)
   - Verification criteria for each step
4. Save plan to `workspace/plans/ultrawork-[timestamp].md`
```

### Phase 2: Execution (Atlas + Workers)
```
5. For each step in the plan:
   a. Mark step as in_progress in todo list
   b. Delegate coding execution via omoc_delegate:
       - omoc_delegate(task_description=..., category="deep")
       - Category auto-selects the right agent (omoc_expert for deep, omoc_coder for quick, etc.)
       - Override with agent_id if needed: omoc_delegate(..., agent_id="omoc_architect")
   c. When sub-agent completion notification is received, immediately:
      - Check the results (do NOT stop!)
      - Verify against success criteria
      - Verification passed → proceed to next step immediately
      - Verification failed → retry (up to 3 times)
   d. Record any learnings in wisdom notepad
   e. Mark step as completed
   f. If step fails after 3 retries:
      - Record issue and continue with next independent step

⚠️ CONTINUATION RULE (Mandatory):
 Sub-agent completion notification = action trigger. Never stop.
 Automatically proceed to the next step until all steps are completed.
 User confirmation is only required when explicitly specified in the plan.
```

### Phase 3: Verification
```
6. Run full verification:
   - Build check (if applicable): `npm run build`, `cargo build`, `go build`, etc.
   - Lint check (if applicable)
   - Test check (if applicable)
   - LSP diagnostics check
7. Fix any issues found during verification
8. Run verification again until clean
```

### Phase 4: Completion
```
9. Generate completion summary:
   - What was done
   - What was changed (files modified/created/deleted)
   - Any issues encountered and how they were resolved
   - Wisdom accumulated
10. Update wisdom notepads with final learnings
11. Mark all todos as completed
```

## Todo Enforcer Integration

During ultrawork execution, the following directive is active:

> You MUST use TodoWrite to track every task. Mark tasks in_progress when starting,
> completed when done. NEVER leave tasks unmarked. If you discover new subtasks,
> add them immediately. Do not stop until all tasks are completed.

## Error Handling

- **Build failures**: Fix immediately, re-verify
- **Test failures**: Fix the code, not the test (unless test is wrong)
- **Lint errors**: Auto-fix where possible, manual fix otherwise
- **Timeout**: Save progress, report partial completion with clear next steps

## Output

The workflow produces:
1. Completed task with all changes applied
2. Plan file in `workspace/plans/`
3. Updated wisdom notepads (if learnings occurred)
4. Completion summary in the conversation
