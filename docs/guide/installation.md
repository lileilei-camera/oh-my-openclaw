# Installation

This guide walks you through installing Oh-My-OpenClaw and getting your AI agent orchestration environment up and running.

---

## Prerequisites

Before installing Oh-My-OpenClaw, ensure the following are in place:

### Required

- **OpenClaw** — The core agent runtime must be installed and accessible in your `PATH`.
  - Verify with: `openclaw --version`
- **Messaging channel** — A configured channel for agent communication (e.g., a Slack workspace, Discord server, or compatible messaging backend).
  - Oh-My-OpenClaw routes agent messages through this channel.

### Optional (Recommended)

- **[OpenCode](https://github.com/sst/opencode)** — AI coding assistant used by several built-in skills.
  - Install: `npm install -g opencode` or follow the OpenCode docs.
- **[Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)** — Required for Gemini-backed agent tasks.
  - Install: `npm install -g @google/gemini-cli`
- **[tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)** — Required for persistent agent sessions and background task management.
  - macOS: `brew install tmux`
  - Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install tmux`
  - Verify: `tmux -V`

## Quick Install
The fastest path to a working installation:

```bash
openclaw plugins install @lileilei-camera/oh-my-openclaw
```

That's it. The plugin registers skills, hooks, and tools automatically. Restart the gateway and you're done.

---


## Plugin Installation
Oh-My-OpenClaw ships as an npm plugin (`@lileilei-camera/oh-my-openclaw`) with full `openclaw.plugin.json` manifest support.

### Via OpenClaw CLI (Recommended)

```bash
openclaw plugins install @lileilei-camera/oh-my-openclaw
```

This installs the plugin, registers all hooks/tools/commands, and loads bundled skills automatically.

### Via Local Link (Development)

```bash
cd path/to/oh-my-openclaw/plugin
npm install && npm run build
openclaw plugins install -l .
```

### Verify

```bash
openclaw plugins list
# Should show: oh-my-openclaw (enabled)
```

> **Tip:** After installation, restart the OpenClaw gateway for changes to take effect.

---

## tmux Setup

Oh-My-OpenClaw uses tmux for persistent agent sessions. Agents run inside a dedicated tmux server so they survive terminal disconnections and can be managed independently.

### Socket Location

All Oh-My-OpenClaw tmux sessions use a shared socket:

```
/tmp/openclaw-tmux-sockets/openclaw.sock
```

### Creating the Socket Directory

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/openclaw-tmux-sockets
```

> **Note:** `/tmp` is cleared on reboot. Add this `mkdir` command to your shell profile or a startup script if you need it to persist across reboots.

### Starting the tmux Server

```bash
tmux -S /tmp/openclaw-tmux-sockets/openclaw.sock new-session -d -s openclaw
```

### Creating Agent Sessions

Each agent can run in its own named tmux window or session:

```bash
# Create a new window for a specific agent
tmux -S /tmp/openclaw-tmux-sockets/openclaw.sock new-window -t openclaw -n my-agent

# List all active sessions
tmux -S /tmp/openclaw-tmux-sockets/openclaw.sock list-sessions

# Attach to the main session
tmux -S /tmp/openclaw-tmux-sockets/openclaw.sock attach -t openclaw
```

### Detaching Without Stopping Agents

Press `Ctrl+B`, then `D` to detach from a tmux session while leaving agents running in the background.

---

## Verify Installation

### 1. Send a Message to an Agent

With OpenClaw running, send a test message through your configured messaging channel:

```
@openclaw ping
```

The agent should respond with a confirmation message. If it does not respond within 30 seconds, check the OpenClaw logs and ensure your messaging channel is correctly configured.

### 2. Run the Test Suite
```bash
cd path/to/oh-my-openclaw/plugin
npm run test
```

**Expected output:**

```
Test Suites: X passed
Tests:       167 passed
```

All tests must pass for a healthy installation (current suite: 167 tests). If any tests fail, review the error output and ensure:
- All dependencies are installed (`npm install`)
- The plugin was built successfully (`npm run build`)
- Your Node.js version meets the minimum requirement (Node 18+)

### 3. Check the Plugin Load

```bash
openclaw status
```

Look for `oh-my-openclaw` listed under loaded plugins. If it is missing, verify the plugin path and rebuild if necessary.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Agent does not respond | Messaging channel misconfigured | Re-check channel credentials in OpenClaw config |
| `npm run build` fails | Missing Node.js or wrong version | Install Node 18+ via `nvm` or your package manager |
| tmux socket not found | `/tmp` was cleared or directory missing | Run `mkdir -p /tmp/openclaw-tmux-sockets` |
| Tests fail | Stale build artifacts | Run `npm run build` then `npm run test` again |
